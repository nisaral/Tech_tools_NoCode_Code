# Building End-to-End ML/NLP/GenAI Projects

## Course Overview
This comprehensive course introduces the foundational concepts of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), and CI/CD Pipelines, guiding you through their practical application in ML, NLP, and GenAI projects across multiple domains:

- Fintech
- Cybersecurity
- Healthcare
- Social Media
- Social Cause

You'll learn a practical workflow, explore both free and paid tools, and see two demonstrations: one with MLflow (free) and another with AWS tools (paid).

## Course Introduction
Building an AI agent—whether it's a fraud detector (Fintech), threat classifier (Cybersecurity), diagnostics tool (Healthcare), content moderator (Social Media), or relief planner (Social Cause)—requires more than just training a model. You need a systematic process to handle data, automate workflows, and deploy solutions reliably.

This course covers:
- **ETL**: How to prepare data for modeling
- **MLOps**: Managing the ML lifecycle from development to production
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automating testing and deployment

By the end, you'll understand these concepts, follow a practical workflow, and see them in action with both free and paid tools.

## Module 1: Understanding Key Concepts

### What is ETL?
**Definition**: ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load, a process to collect raw data, clean/transform it, and load it into a usable format for analysis or modeling.

**Components**:
- **Extract**: Pull data from sources (e.g., APIs, databases, files)
- **Transform**: Clean (e.g., remove duplicates), normalize (e.g., scale values), and enrich (e.g., add features)
- **Load**: Store processed data in a database, file, or ML pipeline

**Why It Matters**: Raw data is messy—ETL ensures it's model-ready.

**Example**: Extract tweets (Social Media), remove profanity (Transform), and save as a CSV (Load) for toxicity detection.

### What is MLOps?
**Definition**: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is a set of practices to automate and manage the ML lifecycle, from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring. It extends DevOps to ML.

**Key Aspects**:
- Data management (via ETL)
- Model training and versioning
- Deployment and scaling
- Monitoring and retraining

**Why It Matters**: Ensures models stay accurate and reliable in production.

**Example**: Automate retraining a Healthcare diagnostics model when new patient data arrives.

### What is a CI/CD Pipeline?
**Definition**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a DevOps practice to automate code/model testing (CI) and deployment (CD).

**Components**:
- **CI**: Test changes (e.g., new data, code updates) automatically
- **CD**: Deploy tested models to production seamlessly

**Why It Matters**: Reduces manual errors and speeds up deployment.

**Example**: Push a Fintech fraud model update to GitHub, test it, and deploy it as an API—all automated.

## Module 2: Workflow for an End-to-End Project

### Step-by-Step Flow
Here's a universal workflow for ML/NLP/GenAI projects with ETL, MLOps, and CI/CD:

1. **Problem Definition**:
   - Define inputs (e.g., transaction logs), outputs (e.g., fraud labels), and metrics (e.g., accuracy)
   - Example: "Classify Cybersecurity emails as phishing or safe"

2. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Automate data collection from sources (e.g., APIs, files)
   - Store raw data in a central location (e.g., Google Sheets, database)

3. **ETL (Preprocessing)**:
   - Extract raw data, clean/transform it (e.g., remove nulls, tokenize text), and load it into a model-ready format
   - Automate with triggers (e.g., new data arrival)

4. **Model Development**:
   - Train a model (e.g., ML classifier, NLP transformer, GenAI generator)
   - Validate and optimize performance

5. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - **CI**: Test preprocessing scripts, model training, and performance on updates
   - **CD**: Deploy the model to production (e.g., API, app) when tests pass

6. **Deployment and Monitoring**:
   - Serve the model (e.g., via API)
   - Monitor performance (e.g., accuracy drift) and retrain as needed
